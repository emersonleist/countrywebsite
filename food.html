                <p>Tako-yaki: Osaka’s most famous specialty is tako-yaki, which is usually translated as “octopus balls.” That doesn’t make it sound very appealing and, anyway, they’re not THOSE balls. They’re actually chunks of octopus legs dipped in batter and cooked in a special round mold. They’re served covered with a savory sauce and dried bonito flakes. They’re one of the world’s great street snacks and even if you don’t really like octopus, you might just like tako-yaki.
                    You’ll find tako-yaki stands all over Osaka, but they’re most common in Dotombori (Minami). Here are two tips: 1) Don’t stand on a long line for tako-yaki – the stuff at the stand next door is probably just as good, and 2) force yourself to wait a few minutes before eating your tako-yaki – they’re always served scalding hot and burnt mouths are the main hazard of eating tako-yaki.</p>

                <p>Ramen: Osaka is a ramen kind of town. The hearty, meaty and plebian nature of the dish is a nature fit for rough and ready Osaka. You’ll find ramen restaurants in every Osaka urban hub, but they’re most numerous in Minami and the Tennoji Area.</p>

            <div class="okonomiyaki">
                <img src="images/okonomiyaki-12.jpg" alt="pic of okonomiyaki">
                <p>Okonomiyaki: Like ramen, okonomiyaki is real Osaka food. It’s cheap, unpretentious and delicious, so naturally Osaka is filled with okonomiyaki restaurants. You’ll find plenty of good ones in Kita, Minami and Tennoji.</p>

            <div class="kushi-katsu">
                <img src="images/Kushikatsu-1.jpg" alt="pic of kushi-katsu">
                <p>Kushi-katsu: The fried food to beat all fried foods, kushi-katsu is another classic Osaka dish. “Kushi” means skewer and “katsu” is derived from “cutlet,” and the name means all kinds of goodies stuck on a stick, dipped in batter and deep fried. As you might imagine, this is drinking food (only someone half drunk would eat this stuff without feeling guilty), so you’ll find kushi-katsu restaurants primarily in drinking areas and entertainment districts. You’ll even sometimes see stalls selling it on the street. The two best areas to find kushi-katsu are Dotombori (Minami) and Shinsekai (Tennoji).</p>
